Multi-Class Image Classification Model – Identify Multiple Image Categories with AI
Unlock the power of computer vision with this Multi-Class Image Classification Model, designed to detect and label images from multiple categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This two-part project—covering both training and testing—not only builds a deep learning model but also demonstrates how to classify a wide range of image types with high accuracy.

Perfect for students, developers, and AI enthusiasts, this project provides a hands-on example of scalable image recognition in Python using TensorFlow/Keras.

What’s Included:

🏗 Training Notebook (multiple_image_classification_training.ipynb):

Loads and processes images from multiple class folders

Builds a CNN architecture tailored for multi-class problems

Trains and validates the model with visual performance metrics

Saves the model for future testing

🧪 Testing Notebook (multiple_image_classification_test.ipynb):

Loads the trained model

Accepts user-supplied images

Predicts and displays the corresponding class label (among several possible categories)

Key Features:

📦 Multi-category image classification (e.g., apples, bananas, oranges, etc.)

🧱 CNN model built from scratch for educational clarity

📉 Real-time accuracy and loss plots for model monitoring

💾 Model saving/loading functionality

🎯 Ideal for practical computer vision use cases or academic learning

Use Cases: Educational projects, machine learning practice, app prototyping, portfolio enhancement, or custom object recognition systems.

Empower your ML journey with this complete, beginner-friendly image classification project that goes beyond binary classification—making AI smarter, one image at a time.
